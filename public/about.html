<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Musa and I currently live in Phoenix, Arizona. <br /> I am an aspiring front end developer currently aiming to get my bachelors degree and teach myself some programming languages along the way as well. <br />  
  My goal right now is to get more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Some interesting facts abot me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a twin.</li>
<li>My favorite music genres are Urbano and Hip-Hop.</li>
<li>I love dogs.</li>
<li>I love the beach.</li>
<li>My favorite color is green.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I decided to learn HTML because I would like to understand both front and back end development.
  I believe figuring out how HTML works will help start me on this journey. Plus I feel like the skills I pick up I can apply to other parts of my life as well. 
  I would also like to start freelancing and help others create their own websites once I am a little more comfortable with JS, and CSS as well.</p>
